1. Use a customer service chat system that persists across various open tabs and doesn't automatically close out mid chat (I got disconnected 3 times or the customer service agents no longer wanted to help me) 
2. Have end user guides that have screenshots of where to click to find different features and aspects of one's wallet. I received the same exact copy and paste message that was not helpful at all and no further guidance was provided like where I should be looking on my screen. 
3. Use tools like https://101.xyz/ to create engaging onboarding experiences for your own platform. You provide this for learning about other chains, but not your own technology. 
4. Make sure end user guides are accessible both in text and video format (such as loom with captions). 
5. Create a bounty program for end users to contribute and create end user documentation as they engage with your wallet, come across challenges, and then overcome them.
